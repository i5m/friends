{ "about": "The first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after leaving her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar. She moves into an apartment with her high school friend Monica and takes up a waitressing job at Central Perk. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, constantly attempts to declare his feelings for her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, including Rachel dating an Italian neighbour named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. She gives birth later in the season and names the child Ben. Joey is a bachelor and struggling actor. Phoebe is working as a masseuse; she is slightly crazy because her mother committed suicide when she was a child. However, the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her over the course of the series. Near the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from a trip.", "timeline": { "S1E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRkNzdiNDEtZjQ2OC00ZTk5LTlmN2MtMGY1MDNjYjMzYWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "28 Apr. 1994", "title": "The One Where Monica Gets a Roommate", "des": "Monica and the gang introduce Rachel to the \"real world\" after she leaves her fianc\u00e9 at the altar.", "rating": "8.4", "vid": ""}, "S1E2": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NzMzMTU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDEyODM0MDE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "29 Sep. 1994", "title": "The One with the Sonogram at the End", "des": "Ross finds out his ex-wife is pregnant.
