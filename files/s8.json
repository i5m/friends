{ "about": "Season 8 begins at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception. When Phoebe and Monica find out that Rachel is the one who had the positive pregnancy test, Rachel takes another pregnancy test, which Phoebe initially pretends is negative, in order to find out how Rachel feels about being pregnant. Rachel becomes sad when she thinks she is not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica then rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy, especially once Ross is revealed to be the father. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship; Ross soon begins going out with Monica's co-worker, Mona (Bonnie Somerville). Joey takes Rachel out on a date to comfort her due to her pregnancy but ends up developing romantic feelings for her. He struggles with his feelings and encourages Rachel to move in with Ross so he does not miss out on the pregnancy. This results in Mona breaking up with Ross when she finds out, and Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially becomes angry but gives Joey his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her but she does not reciprocate his feelings; things between them become awkward for a while but they are able to remain friends. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. While waiting around in the hospital, Monica and Chandler decide to try for a baby. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey picks up Ross's jacket while looking for some tissue. The ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage, while Ross is on his way to her room to ask her if she wants to resume their relationship.", "timeline": { "S8E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjY5MjUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg1ODU0MDE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "27 Sep. 2001", "title": "The One After I Do", "des": "The gang learns that Rachel is pregnant; Joey tries to impress a Broadway director who's dating Chandler's mom; Chandler's shoes make it hard for him to dance.", "rating": "8.7", "vid": ""}, "S8E2": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzOTc0NDc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI5OTU0MDE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "4 Oct. 2001", "title": "The One with the Red Sweater", "des": "Monica, Phoebe and Joey advise Rachel to tell the father about the pregnancy.
