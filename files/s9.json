{ "about": "Season nine begins with Ross and Rachel living together as roommates with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the misunderstanding with the proposal. Monica and Chandler try to have a baby of their own but several obstacles occur: Chandler unknowingly agrees to travel to Tulsa for work; Monica originally intends to go with him but is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth between Tulsa and New York every week. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler soon quits his job and pursues a career in advertising. He starts at an unpaid internship at the agency, but is soon promoted to junior copywriter. Finally, Monica and Chandler find out that they are physically unable to conceive, and after considering surrogacy and sperm donation, decide to adopt instead. Phoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike tells her that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe soon begins dating her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) and he plans on proposing to her, but when Mike proposes first, Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her and they kiss. However, they decide not to do anything about it due to her history with Ross; but Ross, having seen the kiss, tries to get back at Rachel by dating other women. After realizing that her situation with Ross is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey, and Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie (Aisha Tyler), a new paleontology professor whom Ross has a crush on. The group travels to Barbados in the finale to hear Ross give a keynote speech at a paleontology conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common, and Joey realizes that Rachel has feelings for him, but says they cannot pursue this because of Ross. However, upon seeing Ross and Charlie kiss each other, he goes to Rachel's hotel room, and the finale ends with the two of them kissing", "timeline": { "S9E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjEyMzY2ODQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjkxMzYzMzE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "26 Sep. 2002", "title": "The One Where No One Proposes", "des": "Rachel thinks that Joey has proposed to her.
