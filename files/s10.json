{ "about": "The tenth season brings several long-running storylines to a close. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross's feelings about their relationship and decide it would be best to remain friends. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back together with her ex-boyfriend. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). Following this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, including Joey, who becomes upset with the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins, to Monica and Chandler's surprise. Rachel gets fired from her job at Ralph Lauren when her boss catches her secretly interviewing for a new job a Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross tries to get Rachel her job back by secretly meeting with her boss but eventually gives up after realizing that the Paris job is her dream job. When Rachel says a tearful goodbye to everyone but Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together. Rachel leaves, and Ross — who now realizes he is in love with her — chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel realizes she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute to reunite with him. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler's new babies, leaving the apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of the keys to Monica and Chandler's apartment, on the counter table, and then with a shot of the apartment's purple door.", "timeline": { "S10E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MTM2MTM5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg2MzE1NTE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "25 Sep. 2003", "title": "The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss", "des": "Joey and Ross both attempt to come clean to each other that they're dating Rachel and Charlie.
