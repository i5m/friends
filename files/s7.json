{ "about": "Monica and Chandler, who begin to plan their wedding and run into various problems. Joey's television series Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E is canceled, but he is offered his job back on Days of Our Lives; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray's death merely landed him in a four-year-long coma; and the character is revived by getting another character's brain in a transplant. Phoebe's apartment is rebuilt, but it now has only one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel decides to stay with Joey. Rachel receives a promotion at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires an assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks, despite his being under-qualified. Tag learns that she has feelings for him at Thanksgiving and they start a relationship, keeping it hidden from their co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel breaks up with him when she realizes that their six-year age difference makes him too young and immature for her to be dating if she intends to follow her marriage schedule. Just prior to Monica and Chandler's wedding, after Chandler goes into hiding, Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in the bathroom of Monica and Chandler's apartment, assuming it to be Monica's. Ross and Phoebe are able to convince Chandler to return for the ceremony, but he briefly bolts out after finding out about the pregnancy test, only to return later considering the idea of fatherhood. Chandler and Monica get married but when he asks her about the pregnancy test, she denies that it is hers; unbeknown to them it turns out that the positive pregnancy test found in their bathroom belongs to Rachel.", "timeline": { "S7E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQzODlkZWQtZThlNi00ZTdkLWE1ZDMtZWRiMTkxY2JjOWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODc0NjQ1MTY@._V1_UY126_UX224_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "12 Oct. 2000", "title": "The One with Monica's Thunder", "des": "The gang celebrate Monica and Chandler's engagement, however Ross and Rachel upstage them by briefly reuniting.
