{ "about": "Ross and Rachel's marriage turns out to be a drunken mistake that neither of them remembers until it is pointed out by their friends. Ross secretly tries to get an annulment because he does not want to have had three divorces. An annulment turns out to be impossible because of their history and they are forced to get divorced. After becoming annoyed by numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to move in together, causing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine (Elle Macpherson), and they realize they have feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticizes Monica and Chandler. After they break up and Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills and takes up a job as a waiter at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable television series called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E., in which he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating one of his students, Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), despite it being against university rules. He seeks the approval of her father Paul (Bruce Willis), only for Rachel and Paul to start dating instead. Both relationships soon end, because Elizabeth is too immature for Ross and Paul is too emotional for Rachel. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe moves in with Chandler and Monica. During a visit to a museum which offers wedding services with a two-year waiting list, Monica is persuaded by Phoebe and Rachel to put her and Chandler's name on the sign-up sheet for fun. However, the museum leaves a message about an available booking while Chandler is home, causing Chandler to freak out; however, Monica does not know that Chandler is planning to ask Monica to marry him. During dinner, his planned proposal is halted when they encounter her ex-boyfriend Richard, who soon confesses his love for her and his desire to marry and have kids with her. She becomes upset about the situation, especially after Chandler claims he may never want to get married in order to hide his proposal plans, to the point where she visits Richard and complains to him. Chandler is led to believe that Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated for her to propose to him. She is too emotional to finish, so Chandler proposes to her, which she accepts.", "timeline": { "S6E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk0MjMwNjgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIyMzYzMzE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "23 Sep. 1999", "title": "The One After Vegas", "des": "Ross and Rachel deal with the aftermath of their drunken escapade.
