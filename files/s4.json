{ "about": "In the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment. Chandler's relationship with Kathy ends after he discovers that she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients and she accompanies Monica, who has become a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro's, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife, Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests to Joshua that they marry, after which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily's wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily's wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross says Rachel's name at the altar, shocking his bride and the guests.", "timeline": { "S4E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUzNTk3YjYtODNhMy00MWEyLWE4NTctYTYyODVjNjc2NmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgxMjk4MzQ@._V1_UY126_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "25 Sep. 1997", "title": "The One with the Jellyfish", "des": "Ross chooses between Rachel and his bald-headed girlfriend Bonnie; Joey, Chandler, and Monica have a perilous encounter with a jellyfish at the beach.", "rating": "9.1", "vid": ""}, "S4E2": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTk5OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYyMzYzMzE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "2 Oct. 1997", "title": "The One with the Cat", "des": "Phoebe becomes convinced that the spirit of her dead mother is inside a cat.
