{ "about": "Season 3 takes on a significantly greater serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband. Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, and becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take a break from their relationship. Ross, hurt and drunk, sleeps with Chloe, the hot girl from the Xerox place, causing Rachel to break up with him. Chandler has a hard time dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his parents' divorce. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), she becomes acquainted with her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey begins a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), which ends when she receives acting opportunities in Los Angeles. Monica begins a relationship with millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite not initially being attracted to him until they kiss. However, when Pete gets seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion, she breaks up with him. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend Bonnie (Christine Taylor), causing Rachel to get jealous. She tries to sabotage the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross being forced to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.", "timeline": { "S3E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkwNDUwOTgzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUyMzYzMzE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "16 Sep. 1996", "title": "The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy", "des": "Monica suffers from insomnia and depression following her breakup with Richard.
