{ "about": "Rachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season, but later there is friction between them when Rachel discovers a list of cons of dating her made by Ross after he breaks up with Julie. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel watches an old home video and realizes the effort Ross made to stand in for her prom date who nearly stood her up. Monica is fired from her job as chef in the Iridium restaurant for accepting gifts against the company policy and as a result, her savings deteriorate to the point of her having to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 50s-style diner. Joey gets cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, Days of Our Lives as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray, and soon moves out of his and Chandler's apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie (Adam Goldberg). However, Eddie turns out to be an annoying and mentally ill psychopath to Chandler, and Joey's character is killed off after he begins to claim that he writes many of his own lines, bringing him into conflict with the show's writers. With his new apartment being repossessed, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. Chandler gets back together with Janice after they both unknowingly chat with each other online. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend 21 years her senior, but eventually breaks up with him when she realizes that Richard does not want kids.", "timeline": { "S2E1": {"img_src": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMTY5NzQ0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEzMzYzMzE@._V1_UX224_CR0,0,224,126_AL_.jpg", "airdate": "21 Sep. 1995", "title": "The One with Ross's New Girlfriend", "des": "Rachel waits for Ross at the airport, unaware he has a new girlfriend.
